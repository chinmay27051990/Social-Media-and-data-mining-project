# Social-Media-and-data-mining-project
A project named "Stock market prediction using twitter sentiment analysis."

In this project, sentiment analysis on the tweets has been performed to predict stock-market movements. This analysis is based on the support vector regression machine learning model. The application is providing some insights into the correlation between stock prices and twitter-sentiments. We have built a relationship between events or opinions in social media that translate to activity in the stock market like a price drop or a price increase. To conclude we have tried to predict the stock market by mining social media data. To collect user posts or sentiments we have used StockTwits API and Twitter API. To collect stock data IEX API has been used. Python has many useful libraries like JSON, HTML, pickle, Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib, NetworkX, NLTK, etc which we have used for general functionality of the python module. The python module called IEX finance is used to get stock data.
